# Monte-Carlo-Integrator


Numpy and scikit-learn need to be installed, and the following files must be in
the working directory:

    monte_carlo_integrator.py
    weighted_gmm.py
    mcsamper_new.py

To test the monte carlo integrator alone, you need

    test.py

To test mcsampler, you need

    test_mcsampler_new.py

To test the integrator, run

    python3 test.py

To test mcsampler, run

    python3 test_mcsampler_new.py

The integrand, the number of dimensions, the limits of integration, and the grouping of dimensions can all be changed in the test files.
